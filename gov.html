                    When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in
                    Glasgow next week, he will represent the third biggest polluter in the world, with coal accounting
                    for 70% of its power generation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modi's attendance, nevertheless, will be seen as critical, since the leader of the biggest emitter
                    of greenhouse gases, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is not expected to attend.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modi's focus will likely be to portray India as a part of the solution to climate change, rather
                    than the problem.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The South Asian country has not yet submitted its latest plans to combat climate change, but it is
                    expected to revise its goals announced in 2015.

                <p class="news">
                    Moving away from technical or industrial skills, the Green Skill Development Programme was launched
                    in June 2017 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change. 
                    <br>
                    ‘Green skills’ refers to
                    those that contribute to preserve and restore environment and create a sustainable future. Hence,
                    the programme focuses on developing skills among the youth in the environment and forest sector.
                    During the pilot phase, the ministry introduced courses for biodiversity conservationists and
                    para-taxonomists for three months at 10 different locations.<br><br> In May 2018, during the launch of the
                    GSDP mobile app, Union Minister for Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Harsh Vardhan, said
                    that 2.25 lakh people will be employed through GSDP by next year, and about five lakh people by
                    2021.
